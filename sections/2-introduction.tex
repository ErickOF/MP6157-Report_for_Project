\section{Introduction}
In previous research~\cite{obregon2024lsf}, the significance of the heating or temperature control systems across a range of industries including biology, biotechnology, food supply chain, transportation, automotive, agriculture, buildings, and beyond was examined. During the prior study, the methodology was focused on modeling the heating system and implementing a least-squares filter using Simulink. For this work, the approach is centered on the Kalman filter applied to an Arduino DAQ system for a temperature control system.
