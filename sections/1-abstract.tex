Precise temperature surveillance is indispensable across a myriad of everyday and industrial contexts. To tackle this challenge, this paper delves into the exploration of employing a Kalman filter to proficiently attenuate noise in the measured parameter.

For this endeavor, an Arduino DAQ was implemented for temperature measurement. Voltage reading were obtained using the Simulink's analog output block and subsequently converted to temperature units through a MATLAB function. Subsequently, the Kalman filter was applied to mitigate the signal noise.

The analysis of the collected data highlights a promising level of accuracy in the system's predictions. The results indicate that the system demonstrates robustness and reliability in predicting values, even under dynamic temperature conditions.
